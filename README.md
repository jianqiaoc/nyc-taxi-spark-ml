## Project Description

An analysis of NYC Taxi-cab data using python and spark

## (Incomplete) Instructions

Download the full dataset here: http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/ or use the subset in `data/`

Download weather data (fill in your API key for forecast.io first) using `python/get_weather_data.py`

Fix hardcoded paths in `python/generate-models.py` to point to the correct data and python directories

Run locally with `spark-submit`

ToDo: Clean up hardcoded paths

NOTE: This is still a WIP -- the model developed here is expository only
